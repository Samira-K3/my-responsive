                <p>I used to dislike cats a lot. i literally couldn't tolerate them and wanted to kick whenever I see them.  <br><br><br>
                   well in 2019 i was depressed and hurt for some incidents happened to me. i felt a bit lonely. One day i was in my room and suddenly i heard some meowing sound coming from my porch. then i went to check and what i saw made me really angry. there were one big cat with her two newborn children. the cat was looking at me hugging her kittens. i got angry and went to tell it to my parents. they said they would try to kick them out. I felt relief hearing that and ignored the cat. the next day morning i went to check on them and saw that two kittens were playing alone. mother cat wasn't there.i felt it was opportunity and went inside the porch. one kitten hid fast after seeing me. but that second kitten couldn't hide timely and was really afraid. i hold it in my hand with anger wanted to kick it out. she was meowing slowly to get rid of me. suddenly something happened to me. i felt that kitty was too soft white and meowing cutely as if requesting me to leave her. i felt a bit bad for this helpless kitty and just put it where it was instead of kicking it out. then their mother came back and those kitties ran to her and was meowing as if complaining about me. i enjoyed it and also felt really bad about what i did. they are really cute and innocent. day by day i started liking them and used to play with second kitty to whom i used to call billu. billu was afraid but didn't hide when she saw me. i used to play with her. every morning after waking up i went to check on them. whenever i saw them i felt really great and heavenly.i started loving this cat family.that's how it went for some weeks. i started to love kittens since then. well one day that cat family disappeared. maybe they went to other places. i missed the kitty a lot and felt empty. but they were not mine they just came to live somewhere without feelings. i still love and miss my billu.  </p>
